From Quickstart Install dbt Core manually
https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/manual-install?step=1



## Install dbt core
## NOTE: This is done via pip and asks for drivers to install as well
##       Development should be done in venv.  
https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/installation-overview

## Setup BigQuery below are links to setup and load data
https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/bigquery?step=2
https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/bigquery?step=3


# Create git remo
1. Create git repo.
  - existing dbt_fundamentals repo was used

# Create initial dbt project
2. Create a project 
  dbt init jaffle_shop

NOTE: creates a directory called jaffle_shop with the following: 
dbt_project.yml
+ analysis (empty)
+ logs (empty)
+ macros 
   /example
     my_first_dbt_model.sql 
     my_second_dbt_model.sql 
     schema.yml
+ tests (empty)
README.md

# Setup a connection to data source 
# 
3. Need to setup connection details to BigQuery (credentials created and stored from above link)
   This is done in a file called profiles located in ~/.dbt

~/.dbt/profiles: 
jaffle_shop:
  outputs:
    dev:
      dataset: jaffle_shop
      job_execution_timeout_seconds: 300
      job_retries: 1
      keyfile: <location where BigQuery JSON key file is located> 
      location: US
      method: service-account
      priority: interactive
      project: <GCP PROJECT ID>
      threads: 4
      type: bigquery
  target: dev


NOTE:  to test connectivity run:
   dbt debug



# Run sample project 
#
4. Do a test run of the sample project:  
 dbt run

NOTE: should show stages of run anc "Completed Successfully" on successful run


# Build first mmodel 
#
4. build a new model under models directory
models/customer.sql:

        user_id as customer_id,
        order_date,

    from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.orders

        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

select * from final

## v-------END HERE -------v

NOTE:  Models are simply SQL statements, no DDL or DML.  Notice the CTEs for cusotmers, orders, customer_orders
      Dependencies betwee models are identified with {{ ref }} syntax

Now run the updates: 
 dbt run

NOTE:  Tables / views should now be materialized in BigQuery





# Change the way a model is materialized
#
5. By editing dbt_project.yml, you can change the way objects are materialized in the Data Source
dbt_project.yml: 

models:
  jaffle_shop:
    +materialized: table
    example:
      +materialized: view


# Save and dbt run.   customers is now built as a table.  To override dbt_project.yml put the following 
at the beggining of a models .sql file:
models/customers.sql:

{{
  config(
    materialized='view'
  )
}}

with customers as (

    select
        id as customer_id
        ...

)

NOTE: This now builds customers as a view.
WARNING:  Since the customers object has changed from table to view need to run the following: 
    dbt run --full-refresh

This forces a full re-applly of materialization changes. 


## Create models on models 
can build up models on top of base .sql files:

# models/stg_customers.sql:
select
    id as customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name

from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.customers



# models/stg_orders.sql:
select
    id as order_id,
    user_id as customer_id,
    order_date,
    status

from `dbt-tutorial`.jaffle_shop.orders


# models/customers.sql:
# this builds up the customers table by building up CTEs utilizing the {{ ref }} syntax (referral)
# NOTE: Notice the use of CTEs for customers, orders, customer_orders
# models/stg_orders.sql:

with customers as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_customers') }}

),

orders as (

    select * from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}

),

customer_orders as (

    select
        customer_id,

        min(order_date) as first_order_date,
        max(order_date) as most_recent_order_date,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders

    from orders

    group by 1

),

final as (

    select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order_date,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order_date,
        coalesce(customer_orders.number_of_orders, 0) as number_of_orders

    from customers

    left join customer_orders using (customer_id)

)

select * from final



## Add tests to models
## 
Add a schema.yml file under the models directory 
Tests can be added after the column name with the test types.
Here the tests are unique, not_null and accepted values in a list: 


# models/schema.yml: 
....

models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
...
  - name: stg_orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_customers')
              field: customer_id

Run dbt test to confirm all tests passed

In this case there was a failure because there is a null in my_first_dbt_model.id

## Add tests to models
## 

Can generate documentation by adding descripton: fields describing what a table or column does: 

version: 2

models:
  - name: customers
    description: One record per customer
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: Primary key
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: first_order_date
        description: NULL when a customer has not yet placed an order.

Create the documentation with the generate command: 
dbt docs generate
